Problem 15: 

Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and 
only being able to move to the right and down, there 
are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20Ã—20 grid?

This is combination with no repetition: 

where n is the number of things to choose from, 
and we choose r of them, no repetition, order doesn't 
matter. 40 choose 20.

We use a (factored) modified formula to avoid factorial 
overflows
